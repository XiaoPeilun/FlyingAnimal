# FlyingAnimal
An articulated and interactive object in the shape of a flying animal using C and OpenGL

## Aim

Develop an articulated and interactive object in the shape of a flying animal using C and OpenGL. It includes: hierarchical modelling, model rendering, viewing transformations, lighting, interactivity and animation.

## Outcome

The outcome should be an interactive animated 3D articulated object, which can be shaded using three different sets of materials. The material set can be chosen using a popup menu attached to the left button of the mouse. The light source simulates sun light and the time of the day (noon, early evening or late evening) can be changed using a popup menu attached to the right button of the mouse. The object is constantly animated as if it was flying.

## How to run

An Easy way:

1. Open Visual Studio 2015 and create an empty Win32 Console Application
2. Create a .cpp file in source code
3. Project -> Manage NuGet Package
4. Search and download "nupengl.core" and "nupengl.core.redist"
5. Copy the code to the .cpp file you created and run it.
